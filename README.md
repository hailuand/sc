#Space Cannon

###Personal project by Andreas Hailu

Arcade-like rotating cannon game written in Objective-C

In the current iOS SDK 8.1, there's a peculiar bug that causes the circles to stick the edge of the screen. I'm not the only one to experience this, and currently I haven't been able to find a work around.
